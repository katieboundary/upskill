#Upskill

Improve a skill and track your progress using upskill. Upskill was built using ruby, sinatra, the Unsplash API, and the Youtube API. This application allows you to log in and search a skill you would like to improve. Upskill will search the Youtube api for relevant tutorials and the unsplash api will display a related photo. After watching the tutorials, you can record your progress in the input field and refer back to your log to track your progress over time.
